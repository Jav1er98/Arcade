This game is divided into three screens. The game starts with the Main Menu screen, where players have the option to start the game or quit. When the start button is pressed, the game transitions to a new screen the gameplay screen. In this screen, players control a blue ship and their objective is to dodge enemy bullets and destroy enemy ships to earn points. When the player's ship is destroyed, the game moves to the "Game Over" screen. In this screen, players have the option to play again or return to the main menu. The "Game Over" screen displays the player's total score and a message.

In the gameplay screen, the player controls the blue ship while trying to avoid enemy projectiles and eliminate enemies for points. The game features visually appealing projectiles and particle effects that are generated upon collision with enemies. The enemies appear in waves, adding to the challenge. The UI at the bottom of the screen displays the player's remaining lives and score. The game consists of a single level with infinite waves of enemies, allowing players to earn points until they run out of lives and the game ends.

The primary focus during the game's development was to ensure smooth player movement, enemy behavior, and balancing the player's life. Additionally, shooting mechanics were implemented for the player, and enemies were given their own life and scoring system. Visual effects and sound effects were added to enhance the overall experience. Various menu screens were also designed to improve the game's usability.
